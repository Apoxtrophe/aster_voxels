**Efficient Signal Propagation:** Enjoy immediate signal transmission along wires, ensuring synchronized and efficient operation of your circuits without delays.

**Open Sandbox World:** Explore an open-world environment adorned with meticulously crafted pixel-art graphics and an immersive skybox.

**Performance Optimization Tools:** Utilize a suite of performance metrics, debugging tools, and benchmarking utilities to enhance and streamline your gameplay experience.

**Deterministic Voxel Components:** Benefit from simple, deterministic voxel components that behave consistently, allowing for precise and predictable constructions.

# Current Gameplay Opportunities

**Complex Circuit Creation:** Logica is equipped with all the necessary tools to build advanced logic circuits, calculators, computers, and more, using digital logic principles.

**Expanding Feature Set:** The game is continuously evolving, with many more features and enhancements planned for future updates.






# TODO
**Better player movement (minecraft like) with iterpolated slowdown** DONE

**Hotbar for logic components**

**World Saving / Loading**

**Json file for configuration settings**

**In-Game menu**

**Home screen**

**Tiled ground with texture** DONE

**Better cursor texture** DONE

**Unlock the cursor upon pressing a key** DONE

**Latch components and various auxilary logic components such as screen and busses(maybe)**

**Sound effects for the player (walking, placing, destructing and etc)**

**Sounds effects for the logic components (probably making a hum corresponding to the amount of state changes, or on wires nearby)**

## Visual Enhancements
  **Improved shadow calculation and display**
  
  **Ambient occlusion**
  
  **Normal maps**
  
  **Ambient lighting** DONE

  **Better visualization of state for voxel components**
