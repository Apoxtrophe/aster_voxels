#Logica: Voxel-based Logic Simulation Game
Logica is a voxel-based simulation game leveraging the Bevy engine in Rust, focusing on logic operations and interactive environment manipulation. This project blends the elements of construction, puzzle-solving, and real-time logic simulation in a 3D world.

Features
Logic Operations with Voxels: Utilize voxels to build and simulate logic circuits. Supports gates like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

Interactive Voxel Environment: Players can interact with voxels in real-time, enabling the creation, modification, and removal of elements in the game world.

Dynamic Player-Controlled Camera: Incorporates a player-controlled camera system, allowing for 360-degree exploration and interaction.

Real-Time Logic Processing: The game's engine processes logic operations in real-time, reflecting immediate changes in the game world based on player actions and logic gate configurations.

Player Interaction Systems: Includes systems for voxel placement/removal, state alteration, and player movement, enhancing the strategic gameplay experience.

Enhanced Visuals and Atmosphere: Features dynamic lighting and atmospheric effects, creating an immersive visual experience.

Performance Metrics and Debugging Tools: Equipped with modules for performance tracking and debugging, ensuring optimal gameplay and development.

Technical Highlights
Rust Programming Language: Developed using Rust, ensuring memory safety and efficient performance.

Bevy Engine: Utilizes the Bevy game engine, capitalizing on its ECS architecture and parallel processing capabilities.

Voxel-Based Mechanics: Employs a voxel grid system for environment construction and logic simulation.
